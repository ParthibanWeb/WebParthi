    <h1>What is Cavity Wall Insulation?</h1>
<p>If your property was built after 1930 then it is likely to have Cavity Walls. A Cavity
Wall is where the external wall of a house is constructed of two masonry (brick or block)
walls, with a cavity of at least 40mm between. A property with Cavity Walls can usually be
identified by its brick pattern which is known as ‘stretcher bond’, where all the bricks are laid
lengthways. Another way to identify a cavity wall is by the wall thickness, this is usually over
270mm thick.</p>
<p>Cavity Wall Insulation is installed by drilling a series of holes on the mortar joints of the
external wall and injecting a bonded polystyrene bead. Once the cavity is full, the holes are
made good and colour matched as closely as possible to the original mortar. All installs are
supported by a 25-year insurance backed guarantee.
Installing Cavity Wall Insulation can give you an annual saving of up to £300 and
make your home a more comfortable place to live. Funding is available via the ECO
Scheme, get in touch today to establish your eligibility and arrange a free technical
