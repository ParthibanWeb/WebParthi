   <h1> Internal Wall Insulation (IWI)</h1>
<p>Internal wall insulation is the insulation of the internal surface of the external walls,
so it is a great alternative to external wall insulation and in our opinion a better
measure for properties with good character. Nearly half of all heat loss from solid
walled properties occurs by heat escaping through the walls. Insulating these walls
will slow down the rate of heat loss and keep the warmth inside your home for
longer. Internal wall insulation works by adding an extra layer of insulation to the
internal walls and can really improve the standard of finish in your property. Our
internal wall insulation is installed by mechanically fixing and gluing insulated PIR
boards on to existing walls within your property.</p>
