    <h1>Room in Roof (RIR)</h1>


<p>To put it simply, a ‘Room in roof’ is a room within your roof space that is accessed
via a fixed staircase. It will usually have sloping ceilings visible in the room, however
if there are full width dormer windows present, there may not be any sloping ceilings
visible. A room in roof could be a converted roof space such as a loft conversion or
an original part of the design such as the upper floor in a dormer bungalow. </p>

<h2>Why have ‘Room in Roof’ Insulation?</h2>
<p>
The UK currently has one of the oldest housing stock in Europe, meaning many
houses were built without energy efficiency in mind. This could mean that you are
losing the use of valuable space due to certain rooms being draughty, cold or hard
and expensive to heat, you could also be losing up to 25% of the heat in your home
through uninsulated roofs. Installing Room in Roof insulation at no cost to you will
keep you cool in the summer and warm in the winter, lower your carbon emission
and reduce your heating bill, saving you £100s per year, in some cases £1000s!</p>
