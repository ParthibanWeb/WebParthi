    <h1>Choosing loft insulation</h1>
<p>If your loft is easy to access and has no damp or condensation problems it should be easy to insulate. If access is easy and your loft joists are regular, you can use rolls of mineral wool insulation. The first layer is laid between the joists – the horizontal beams that make up the floor of the loft – then another layer is laid at right angles to cover the joists and make the insulation up to the required depth. This can be done by someone  competent in DIY or a professional installer.</p>
